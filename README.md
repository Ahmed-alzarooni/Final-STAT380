*Project: Energy Access and Poverty Eradication*

# Project Overview

This project is conducted by Ahmed Alzarooni, focusing on understanding the relationship between access to electricity and poverty levels in Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The analysis aims to identify the LDCs with the lowest rates of electrification, explore their energy sources, and understand the infrastructure challenges they face. Furthermore, it investigates how increased access to clean and affordable energy can contribute to poverty reduction, enabling improvements in income generation, education, and healthcare.
